# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model comparison, it demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building an effective classification system.

# Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between patient features and disease risk

Data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling

# Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### Model evaluation using accuracy score and classification reports

### Comparison of models to identify the best-performing approach

# Workflow
- Data Loading: Import dataset using Pandas
- EDA: Visualize distributions and correlations of features
- Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values
- Label encoding categorical columns
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Model Building:
- Train/test split
- Fit models using scikit-learn and XGBoost

## Evaluation:
